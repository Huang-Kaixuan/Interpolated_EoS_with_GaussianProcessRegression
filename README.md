# Interpolated EoS with Gaussian Process Regression Method
This program is used to perform interpolation with Gaussian process regression method to predict the target values at given points. 
## The specific files included in this deposit
* `Code_Description.md:` A Markdown file documenting the variables and logic of the code of the program "GPREOS.ipynb".
* `GPREOS.ipynb:` A Jupyter notebook.
* `GPREOS.html:` An HTML rendering of the Jupyter notebook.
* `GPREOS.pdf:` A PDF rendering of the Jupyter notebook.
* `eos.dat:` The input file. 
The first column in "eos.dat" is the baryon number density, the second column is the pressure. The first half of the data is the EoS of the hadron phase, and the second half is the EoS of quark phase. Please delete the comments in "eos.dat" before using this input file and keep only the data.
