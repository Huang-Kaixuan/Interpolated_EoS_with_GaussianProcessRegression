# Title: The Hadron-Quark Crossover in Neutron Star within Gaussian Process Regression Method
Authors: Huang K., Hu J., Zhang Y., Shen H. 

This deposit includes the python code for some part of the EoSs of hadron-quark 
crossover with the GPR method, "GPREOS.ipynb". The specific files included in this deposit are listed
and described below:
## The specific files included in this deposit
* `Code_Description.md:` A Markdown file documenting the variables and logic of the code of the program "GPREOS.ipynb".
* `GPREOS.ipynb:` A Jupyter notebook.
* `GPREOS.html:` An HTML rendering of the Jupyter notebook.
* `GPREOS.pdf:` A PDF rendering of the Jupyter notebook.
* `eos.dat:` The input file. 
The first column in "eos.dat" is the baryon number density, the second column is the pressure. The first half of the data is the EoS of the hadron phase, and the second half is the EoS of quark phase. Please delete the comments in "eos.dat" before using this input file and keep only the data.
